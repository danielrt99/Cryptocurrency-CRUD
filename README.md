# Cryptocurrency-CRUD
https://replit.com/@DanielCho6/cryptocurrency-crud?embed=1&output=1 

The premise of my CRUD is for someone to be able to make a wallet/portfolio consisting of the top 50 cryptocurrencies on the crypto.com exchange. They can add/remove cryptocurrencies, delete wallets, recover deleted wallets, and view the net balance of as many wallets as they create. 

Create Inventory Items: 
	I added the ability to create wallets

Edit Them:
	I added the ability to add and remove cryptocurrencies from the wallets. The cryptocurrencies available are the Top 50 cryptocurrencies exchanged on crypto.com

Delete Them:
	I added the ability to delete the wallets, and also add deletion comments

View a list of them:
	I added the ability to view all wallets and also output the value of each wallets portfolio based on the price of each cryptocurrency from crypto.com

Recover them:
I added the ability to recover a wallet after deleting it. You will be able to see deletion comments in the process of recovery.
